My solutions to some questions of the [2023 Lucid Programming Competition](https://www.hackerrank.com/lpc-2023). I used about 3 out of the 4 hours allotted and placed 87th overall. I think I could have done 2 or 3 more if I used all of my time and used Python instead of Rust. Rust is my favorite language right now, but I have more problem-solving experience with Python (it's my main Leetcode language), it has a better standard library for certain things (e.g. `dict.setdefault()`), and some of Rust's safety features get in the way for quick programming.
